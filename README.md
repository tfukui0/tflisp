A Multiway Directional Programming Language "RIPPLE"


This is a multiway directional programming model for practical many programs like the business systems, WEB systems, service solutions, etc. It is realize to automatic programming easily. The paper is http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0322.

The RIPPLE is running with TF-LISP. But it use different parser and user I/F. TF-LISP was originally developed by me. It's a subset interpreter of Common-LISP, but extended.

See the http://sourceforge.net/p/tflisp/

The first idea is made in 1993. The research became to finish. All patents were abandoned. It's can use everyone freely.
